# issue-with-shadow-root-and-microsoft-edge-translator

This repo provides a simple example to highlight the issue with text inside encapsulated web components and the Microsoft Edge Translator when making changes to the shadow DOM.
Inside the example is also a "DOM-nudging" workaround for the same issue in Google Chrome, that doesn't work in Microsoft Edge.
